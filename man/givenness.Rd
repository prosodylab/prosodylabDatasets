\description{
When we speak, some words have more emphasis than others: this is an aspect of prosody that linguists call *prosodic prominence*. Words that encode new or contrastive are likely to be prominent (e.g., they are likely to carry a pitch accent), words that encode old or repeated information are likely to be reduced and hence not prominent (e.g, they are unlikely to carry an accent)---unless they are contrastive. This experiment is an illustration of the 'Williams Effect': In English, a phrase-final word cannot be accented if a previous phrase ended in a homophonous accented word, even if it encodes contrastive information (e.g. the following sentence sounds odd if the final 'Betsy' is accented: 'Daniel followed Betsy, then Daniel was followed by Betsy.'). This suggests that speakers treat them as if they were merely contextually given and not contrastive, a 'givenness illusion'. For more information about contrast in general and the experiment in particular, please take a look at the references.
